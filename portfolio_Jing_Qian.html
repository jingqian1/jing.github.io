      <p>Des 115 Minimal Letterforms</p>

<p>This project is to learn different typefaces better. At first, I studied and analysis 6 different typefaces, then I chose Garamond for my further project. I chose 4 letters and enlarged them to be as big as possible but still legible enough to tell the letter. Then I arranged them together and determined how the negative space should interact with the letters. </p>

      <p>This is an advertisement design for a series of events.  The most important focus in my design is legibility. Since the purpose of this project is to convey the messages as clear and as fast as possible, I chose to arrange all the information neatly and organized. So it’s clear that there are three events in total, and locations, time, and the lecturers for each event.  </p>

<p>This is a book design project that all contents are given. For this project, I first learned the common sizes for different kinds of books. For this one, I chose 6*8inch size because it fits the space I design for the book. Then I learn the grid design for the book and did type studies to decide which font would fit the size of my book. </p>

              <p>This project is 17 pages hand-made storybook. All pages are using things I’ve learned from Des 15: form and color, which includes pop-up page,  black and white negative space, and color blending. </p>
