          <h3>Minimal Letterforms</h3>

          <p>This project is to learn different typefaces better. At first, I studied and analysis 6 different typefaces, then I chose Garamond for my further project. I chose 4 letters and enlarged them to be as big as possible but still legible
            enough to tell the letter. Then I arranged them together and determined how the negative space should interact with the letters. </p>

          <h3>Poster Design</h3>
          <p>In this project, I designed an event poster that includes image, typography, and proper color scheme using Photoshop & Illustrator. I chose an exhibition “Rene Magritte: The Fifth Season” hold by SFMOMA. My design idea for this poster
            was to put Magritte’s painting as the main thing. So it makes people to receive the most important information immediately and makes them want to stay and look at this poster. I also adjusted the tracking and kerning of the text of the
            SFMOMA, so it looks like the original logo of SFMOMA. </p>

          <h3>Typographic Studies | Information Design</h3>
          <p>This is an advertisement design for a series of events. The most important focus in my design is legibility. Since the purpose of this project is to convey the messages as clear and as fast as possible, I chose to arrange all the
            information neatly and organized. So it’s clear that there are three events in total, and locations, time, and the lecturers for each event. </p>

          <h3>Interior Design</h3>
          <p> I used Illustrator to create an original drawing an interior space in 2-point perspective. I also applied four differents color-schemes
            variations: analogous, complementary, triadic, and monochromatic. In this project, it was hard at first to draw on the computer by mouse. I designed a bar scene with two people sitting in order to illustrate the size of the bar. One
            interesting thing of this design was the bubble lights, which created the relaxing mood.

          <h3>Page Design | Book Design</h3>
          <p>This is a book design project that all contents are given. For this project, I first learned the common sizes for different kinds of books. For this one, I chose 6*8inch size because it fits the space I design for the book. Then I learn
            the grid design for the book and did type studies to decide which font would fit the size of my book. </p>

          <h3>Handmade Book</h3>
          <p>This project is 17 pages hand-made storybook. All pages are using things I’ve learned from Des 15: form and color, which includes pop-up page, black and white negative space, and color blending. </p>
