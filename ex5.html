  <h1>Garamond</h1>

  <h2>Designers</h2>
  <p> The designers of Garamond include: Claude Garamond, Robert Granjon, and Jean Jannon.</p>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p> The purpose of Garamond typefaces is for printing body text and books.</p>

  <h2> Websites that are using Garamond</h2>
  <p> This is one example of the websites that are using the Garamond: <a href="http://theforecaster-interactive.com/">The theforecaster</a>.
    And also, there are many books using Garamond as well, such as "Type in a book" by Jacques Dubois and printed in 1531 by Robert Estienne.
    <br><br> We think they are using effectively because the purpose of Garamond was made for books and in large amount of articles. We like Garamond because it increase the legibility of the letters.
Garamond were thinner and more delicate than those before it, which both allowed the ink to bleed on the page without overly distorting the words and used less ink. They also were more decorative than those modeled directly from the hand. Garamond was created in 1530 and it has been using for a long time after then, and even now many designers still have strong prefrence on it. </p>
